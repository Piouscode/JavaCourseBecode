In lines of code, my thoughts take flight
A programmer's world, both day and night
A language that speaks to machines
A symphony that only coders dream

Syntax and logic, rules to abide
Debugging and testing, never to hide
Infinite possibilities, a canvas to paint
A world to create, never to faint

Errors are hurdles, bugs to be squashed
Patience and persistence, a price to be bought
Code is the magic, the wand we all wield
The key to unlock, the world we build

With each line, a new story unfolds
An adventure, a journey, waiting to be told
Coding is art, a masterpiece in the making
A canvas of logic, a world in the coding.
